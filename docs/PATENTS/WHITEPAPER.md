## Abstract

This document outlines RSIGE — a decentralized genealogy, identity, and DNA-based
authentication system built on the principles of privacy, consent, sovereign data
ownership, and verifiable lineage. Unlike existing genealogy or DNA services,
RSIGE stores **no raw DNA, no PII, and no user accounts**. Identity and lineage
proof is established using **cryptographically-derived keys from genomic data**
combined with a **triple-ledger archival model**.

This becomes the foundation for future systems including:

- genome-personalized pharmaceutical printing,
- healthcare decision AI,
- device & network authentication,
- civic participation verification,
- inheritance, estate, & historical continuity,
- long-term family data preservation.

The system is fully open-source and **duplicable by any family**, beginning with
the Randolph lineage as the first operational node.

## Core Innovation

> **DNA becomes a private cryptographic key — not shared, not stored, not exposed.**
>  
> Genealogy becomes a **permission-based sovereign map of human connection.**
>  
> Identity becomes **something you own, not something you sign into.**

## Problem With Existing Systems

| System | Problem |
|---|---|
| Ancestry/23andMe | Harvests DNA + sells data + central authority ownership |
| Government ID systems | Frail, forgeable, requires central oversight |
| Login/password accounts | Hackable, phishable, identity not sovereign |
| Medical records | Fragmented, non-portable, user not owner |
| Genealogy platforms | Centralized, account-based, data monetized |

None solve **sovereign identity**, **lifelong verifiable lineage**, or **genome-driven personalization**.

RSIGE does.

## System Design Overview

RSIGE consists of four architectural pillars:

1. **Genealogy Graph + Family Wiki Structure**
2. **DNA Hash Identity Protocol (No Raw Genome Stored)**
3. **Triple Ledger Trust System**
4. **Genome-Drift Update & Pharmaceutical Calibration**

### Pillar 1: Genealogy Graph & Wiki

- Each individual = a profile node  
- Nodes reference parents, children, spouses  
- Relationships cryptographically signed  
- Public visibility always user-permissioned  
- Private records stored encrypted client-side

### Pillar 2: DNA Hash Identity Protocol

- DNA sample → sequenced externally → hashed
- Hash generates a **private key**
- Private key generates **public key**
- Public key is used for verification, NOT identity storage
- No central server ever holds raw genome

Result: **identity without exposure**.

### Pillar 3: Triple Ledger System

| Ledger | Purpose | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Public Ledger | Published family history | Public view |
| Private Ledger | PII, letters, audio, DNA hash | Owner only |
| Verification Ledger | Proof records & signatures | Public cryptographic trust |

Blockchain optional — merkle tree sufficient.

### Pillar 4: Genome Drift Tracking

DNA changes over life → immune, epigenetic, methylation, aging.

- periodic re-sequencing updates hash signature
- pharmaceutical personalization auto-adjusts
- AI tracks drift patterns → health recommendations

This makes **lifelong identity + medicine synchronization** possible.

## Conclusion

This system is designed not just to **record the past**, but to **secure the future**.

Your family tree becomes your identity token, your health passport, your ancestral archive, and your generational legacy — all without giving your data to corporations or governments.

The Randolph lineage is **Node 001**.

Every family who forks this becomes **Node 00X**.

A global web of sovereign identity — rooted in genealogy, protected by DNA, powered by StegVerse.
