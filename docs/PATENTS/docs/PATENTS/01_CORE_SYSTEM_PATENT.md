# PATENT 01 — User-Sovereign Genealogy System

### Working Title:
**Decentralized Genealogical Record System with User-Controlled Public Visibility and Consent-Driven Ancestral Publishing**

### Abstract
A genealogy platform enabling users to independently construct family lineage
trees without accounts or centralized data, where each user retains full control
over their own information and visibility. Ancestral records become publishable
only with cryptographic consent from direct descendants providing verified proof.

### Claims

1. A genealogical data structure where **each person controls their own data visibility**.
2. No central account required — identity storage is **client-side, user-owned**.
3. Consent-based publishing where a descendant can **authorize deceased ancestor records**.
4. A **forkable open-source format** allowing any family to duplicate infrastructure.
5. Linkage engine capable of **discovering related lineages without exposing PII**.
6. Public/private **triple-ledger structure** ensuring source integrity.
