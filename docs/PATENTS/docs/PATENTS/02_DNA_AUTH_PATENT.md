# PATENT 02 — DNA Sovereign Identity Authentication Key

### Abstract
A method for converting genomic sequence data into a **non-reversible authentication
key**, enabling user identity verification without exposing raw DNA.

### Claims

1. DNA processed into **hash-based private identity keys**.
2. Genome never stored raw — only encrypted reference signatures.
3. DNA updates create **drift-based rekeying events**.
4. The key enables authentication across devices, medical systems, voting systems.
5. Genome-based pharmaceutical calibration without PII exposure.
6. User retains exclusive control — zero data held by authority.
