# Ethical Charter for Human Sovereign Identity

1. Human dignity > technological convenience.
2. Consent is explicit, revocable, and auditable.
3. No genome data ever leaves user custody unencrypted.
4. Users control visibility of their identity and ancestors.
5. Historical preservation is encouraged, exploitation forbidden.
6. AI must be advisory — final authority is human.
7. No government, corporation, or entity may demand access
   without voluntary cryptographic release by owner.
8. The dead are protected — their stories preserved with honor.
9. DNA lineage does not define value — it only tells history.
10. The future inherits integrity or nothing at all.
